[Lab Notes: My Closed-Loop Research System](http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2011/06/23/lab-notes-my-closed-loop-research-system/) \#article - by Cal Newport. "Now that I’m a month away from starting [my new position at Georgetown](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/06/01/quick-hits-my-move-to-georgetown-live-interview-and-experiments-with-forced-batching/), I’ve arrived at a relatively stable research strategy. I assume it will evolve as I gain more experience as a professor, and I’m somewhat nervous that the more experienced among you will scoff at my naivety, but it’s a starting point — a way to start my new position with a _proactive_ \(not reactive\) mindset."

[Public Books Database](https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database/) - "With university classrooms and libraries shuttered because of the COVID-19 crisis, scholars are facing disruptions not only in their teaching lives but also in their ability to access research materials. In response, many academic presses have made hundreds of their titles freely accessible online. The Public Books Database aims to catalog such resources in a single location and to highlight titles of particular interest. We’ll be updating the [list](https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database/#list) regularly as additional materials are made available."

[Commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) \#article - Wikipedia. “**Commonplace books** \(or **commonplaces**\) are a way to compile [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), usually by writing information into [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book). They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance) and in the nineteenth century. Such books are essentially [scrapbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapbooking) filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is unique to its creator’s particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler’s responses. They became significant in [Early Modern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Europe).”

[DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) \#software - "Focus on your work and let DEVONthink remember all the details. Collect, organize, edit and annotate documents of any kind. Have them automatically analyzed, connected, and filed. Sync them between your Mac, iPhone, and iPad." Highly recommended by the author of [_Where Good Ideas Come From_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8034188-where-good-ideas-come-from?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=LBNJGbLTWR&rank=1)_,_ Steven Johnson. He says the app finds connections between pieces of research based on word frequencies and word neighborhoods that a normal search engine wouldn't find. He'll draft a paragraph, put it into the app, and the app finds all his research that might be related. He then looks at the connections with those notes, and soon has a large number of pieces of information forming a new idea that he may not have initially thought of.

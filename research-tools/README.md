[Commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) \#article - Wikipedia. “**Commonplace books** \(or **commonplaces**\) are a way to compile [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), usually by writing information into [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book). They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance) and in the nineteenth century. Such books are essentially [scrapbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapbooking) filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is unique to its creator’s particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler’s responses. They became significant in [Early Modern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Europe).”

[Lab Notes: My Closed-Loop Research System](http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2011/06/23/lab-notes-my-closed-loop-research-system/) \#article - by Cal Newport. "Now that I’m a month away from starting [my new position at Georgetown](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/06/01/quick-hits-my-move-to-georgetown-live-interview-and-experiments-with-forced-batching/), I’ve arrived at a relatively stable research strategy. I assume it will evolve as I gain more experience as a professor, and I’m somewhat nervous that the more experienced among you will scoff at my naivety, but it’s a starting point — a way to start my new position with a _proactive_ \(not reactive\) mindset."

[Public Books Database](https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database/) - "With university classrooms and libraries shuttered because of the COVID-19 crisis, scholars are facing disruptions not only in their teaching lives but also in their ability to access research materials. In response, many academic presses have made hundreds of their titles freely accessible online. The Public Books Database aims to catalog such resources in a single location and to highlight titles of particular interest. We’ll be updating the [list](https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database/#list) regularly as additional materials are made available."

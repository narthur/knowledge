[The high cost of free parking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akm7ik-H_7U&list=PLIilwIraDV2LQHeTYrboyJ7VGzGImXjoz&index=2) \#video - "Hidden parking rules hurt our cities. Will Chilton and Paul Mackie of Mobility Lab explain."

[How to Build a City Around Bikes, Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-I6HFQXquU) \#video - "Around the world cycling lanes are popping up and bike shops are selling out. As the coronavirus pandemic means people need to avoid subways and buses the bicycle is having a renaissance.

[What if... we all drove electric vehicles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gRS7PK6TP0&list=PLIilwIraDV2LQHeTYrboyJ7VGzGImXjoz&index=2) \#video - "Transport is a large contributor to New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions and most of these emissions are from light passenger vehicles. If we all drove electric vehicles, powered with renewable energy, we could reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions significantly. However today most New Zealanders drive internal combustion engine cars and not all of our electricity generation is from renewable sources, which raises questions around whether we could convert our vehicle fleet to electric vehicles and whether this will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the other side of the argument, electric vehicles are readily available today. They’re becoming more affordable, and New Zealand has plenty of wind and geothermal renewable generation planned. This talk will look at the history of electric vehicles and their technology, and consider the impact on our electricity power system if we all drove electric vehicles. It will also touch on the environmental impacts for New Zealand and other countries from converting to electric vehicles, first-hand experience of owning an electric vehicle, and the need for skills and training in New Zealand to cope with the rise of new technologies in the electricity sector, which includes electric vehicles."

[Why Car-Free Streets May Be Here to Stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2HvW2iGNRk) \#video - "While increasing automobile traffic has been a growing problem in major U.S. cities, the threat of Covid-19 has revealed what life could look like without car-clogged streets.

[This Farm of the Future Uses No Soil and 95% Less Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_tvJtUHnmU&list=PLIilwIraDV2LQHeTYrboyJ7VGzGImXjoz) \#video - "As urban populations continue to rise, innovators are looking beyond traditional farming as a way to feed everyone while having less impact on our land and water resources. Vertical farming is one solution that's been implemented around the world. Vertical farms produce crops in stacked layers, often in controlled environments such as those built by AeroFarms in Newark, New Jersey. AeroFarms grows a variety of leafy salad greens using a process called "aeroponics," which relies on air and mist. AeroFarms' crops are grown entirely indoors using a reusable cloth medium made from recycled plastics. In the absence of sun exposure, the company uses LED lights that expose plants to only certain types of spectrum. AeroFarms claims it uses 95% less water than a traditional farm thanks to its specially designed root misting system. And it is now building out a new 70,000 square foot facility in a former steel mill. Once  completed, it's expected to grow 2 million pounds of greens per year, making it the largest indoor vertical farm in the world."

## Climate Change

[Carbon Dioxide Is Not the Worst Greenhouse Gas, Meet SF6](https://invidio.us/watch?v=uGpDFgTfRYU) \#video - "SF6 is a colorless, odorless, cheap and non-flammable synthetic gas that is incredibly effective at insulating material for medium- and high-voltage electrical installation. Because sulfur hexafluoride displaces the air that feeds the flames, SF6 is used to help prevent short circuits and fires in high-voltage electrical switches and circuit breakers."

[What if... we all drove electric vehicles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gRS7PK6TP0&list=PLIilwIraDV2LQHeTYrboyJ7VGzGImXjoz&index=2) \#video - "Transport is a large contributor to New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions and most of these emissions are from light passenger vehicles. If we all drove electric vehicles, powered with renewable energy, we could reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions significantly. However today most New Zealanders drive internal combustion engine cars and not all of our electricity generation is from renewable sources, which raises questions around whether we could convert our vehicle fleet to electric vehicles and whether this will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the other side of the argument, electric vehicles are readily available today. They’re becoming more affordable, and New Zealand has plenty of wind and geothermal renewable generation planned. This talk will look at the history of electric vehicles and their technology, and consider the impact on our electricity power system if we all drove electric vehicles. It will also touch on the environmental impacts for New Zealand and other countries from converting to electric vehicles, first-hand experience of owning an electric vehicle, and the need for skills and training in New Zealand to cope with the rise of new technologies in the electricity sector, which includes electric vehicles."

[How San Francisco Is Becoming A Zero Waste City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3OA1s8-SI&list=PLIilwIraDV2LQHeTYrboyJ7VGzGImXjoz&index=2) \#video - "According to the EPA, the national recycling rate in the U.S. is only about 34%. That means most of our solid waste goes to landfills and incinerators - including recyclable items like paper, glass, metal and plastic. Massive amounts of food waste that can be composted is clogging landfills, creating dangerous greenhouse gases. Many cities are starting to tackle this problem by implementing policies to help curb the waste by recycling and composting more. It's known as the "zero waste" movement, and San Francisco is on the forefront. Other cities that have zero waste goals include Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, Austin, and Oakland. But San Francisco has been the most aggressive. In 2009 the board of supervisors passed an ordinance requiring all residents and business to recycle and compost their waste, making it the first American city to make composting mandatory. Its goal is to achieve zero waste by 2020, and it has diverted 80% of its waste from landfills so far. Now the city is getting attention from all around the world. Government officials from China, Italy, France, Denmark, India and many other countries have visited San Francisco's state of the art recycling and composting facilities in hopes of learning how to replicate its success."

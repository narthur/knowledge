[Baby Got Bonus: Beeminding Your Way to Awesome](https://www.graysonbraymorris.com/baby-got-bonus/) \#article - "Way back in November of 2014, I discovered a productivity tool that would turn out to actually work for me. And more than just work: it’s been amazing. It’s helping me [achieve goals I’ve had for decades](https://www.beeminder.com/grayson)—goals I always abandoned, time after time after time, when the first flush of enthusiasm waned. Here’s a major part of the reason why."

[Beeminder API](https://api.beeminder.com/#beeminder-api-reference)

[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/home) \#webapp - "Your goals can be anything quantifiable — weight, pushups, minutes spent on Facebook, points on Duolingo. Answer with your number when Beeminder asks — or connect a device/app below to auto-report — and we'll show your progress and a Yellow Brick Road to follow to stay on track. If you go off track, you pledge money to stay on the road the next time. If you go off track again, we charge you."

[Beemind.me](https://beemind.me/) - "This app complements [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com/) by adding more automatic data sources.  
Check the list below to see what is currently supported."

[Nifty trick for “days I did this other goal” goals](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/nifty-trick-for-days-i-did-this-other-goal-goals/1175) \#thread - "I made a new IFTTT recipe. If a datapoint is added to weight\_loss, add a datapoint of 1 to weigh\_days. Then, go into weigh\_days, turn it into a custom goal, and set the aggregation to “binary”. This means that no matter how many times I weigh in in one day, the day will have a value of 1 if I add data, and a value of 0 if I do not–and it’s all completely automatic!"

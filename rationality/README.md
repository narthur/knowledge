[Charles Murray vs Milo, and the "good faith" principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ub73hWrORo) \#video - "I explain why I think the "good faith" principle implies that we should give people like Charles Murray, but not Milo, a platform to share their ideas. \(Not saying Milo should be legally banned from speaking, just that we shouldn't be going out of our way to give him opportunities to speak.\) I also argue that the "good faith" principle is inherently subjective and that this doesn't negate its importance."

[How Do You Evaluate Your Own Predictions?](https://commoncog.com/blog/how-do-you-evaluate-your-own-predictions/) \#article - "This post provides a comprehensive summary of the technique that Tetlock and Gardner presents in _Superforecasting_. It is divided into two parts: part one \(this week\) is about the rules and evaluation criterion that GJP uses to evaluate forecasters. I've presented this in the context of an interested practitioner; I'm assuming you might want to improve forecasting decisions in your own life, but you don't have the time to implement a rigorous forecasting tournament in your organisation."

[How Good Are FiveThirtyEight Forecasts?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/checking-our-work/) \#article - "Forecasts have always been a core part of FiveThirtyEight’s mission. They force us \(and you\) to think about the world probabilistically, rather than in absolutes. And making predictions, whether we’re modeling a candidate’s chance of being elected or a team’s odds of making the playoffs, improves our understanding of the world by testing our knowledge of how it works — what makes a team or a candidate win."

[Is Most Published Research Wrong?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q) \#video - "Mounting evidence suggests a lot of published research is false."

[Mental Models: The Best Way to Make Intelligent Decisions \(109 Models Explained\)](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) \#article - "Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason."

[PredictionBook](https://predictionbook.com/) - "Rather than just recording **what** you think will happen, PredictionBook allows you to record just how sure you are that it will happen. You can distinguish between those things you think will probably occur, and those things you're really really sure will occur. If you're properly calibrated, you'll be able to see that about 60% of the things you're 60% sure will happen, do happen, and 90% of the things you're 90% sure will happen, do happen."

[The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't by Nate Silver \| Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise?from_search=true&qid=MEEN6mCMC4&rank=1) \#book - "Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the "prediction paradox": The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future."

[Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets) \#book - "Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success \(and avoiding worrying yourself to death\) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making?"

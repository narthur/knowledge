# Creativity

[Babble](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i42Dfoh4HtsCAfXxL/babble) #article - "How do human beings produce knowledge? When we describe rational thought processes, we tend to think of them as essentially deterministic, deliberate, and algorithmic. After some self-examination, however, I've come to think that my process is closer to babbling many random strings and later filtering by a heuristic. I think verbally, and my process for generating knowledge is virtually indistinguishable from my process for generating speech, and also quite similar to my process for generating writing."

[The Beautifully Strange World of Outsider Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVks07UgVQQ) #video - "Whether we're talking about The Shaggs, Wesley Willis, B.J. Snowden, Eilert Pilarm, Shooby Taylor, Gary Wilson, R. Stevie Moore, Tiny Tim, Luie Luie, Daniel Johnston, or whoever else -- this category of music is all about originality/authenticity. These musicians and artists aren't the most polished in the world, but they make up for it with passion and creativity. Open your mind up, go down the rabbit hole of outsider music, and have a good time!"‌

[My Video Went Viral. Here's Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHsa9DqmId8\&feature=youtu.be) #video - "My hypothesis is that the algorithm, rather than viewer preference, drives views on the site. As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site."

## Play

[Richard Feynman on choosing only to work on problems that he found interesting regardless of value](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html?repostindays=413) #article - "Then I had another thought: Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to _enjoy_ doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to _play_ with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn't have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with. When I was in high school, I'd see water running out of a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I could figure out what determines that curve. I found it was rather easy to do. I didn't _have_ to do it; it wasn't important for the future of science; somebody else had already done it. That didn't make any difference. I'd invent things and play with things for my own entertainment."

[Caring with cash, or How Radiohead could have made more money](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/07/15/caring-with-cash-or-how-radiohead-could-have-made-more-money/#.XO_p8tNKjUI) \#article - "In October 2007, the British band Radiohead released their seventh album – [_In Rainbows_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rainbows) – as a digital download that customers could pay whatever they liked for. The results of this risky venture are a guarded secret, but the album’s popularity was clear. It topped the charts and allegedly sold [1.2 million copies in the first day alone](http://www.gigwise.com/news/37670/exclusive-radiohead-sell-12million-copies-of-in-rainbows). Even though many fans paid nothing \(the [average contribution](http://andrewdewaard.com/publications/Radiohead,%20Big%20Music,%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20the%20Record%20Industry%20-%20Andrew%20deWaard.pdf) ranged from $2.26 to around $8 [depending on](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2633798.ece) [the survey](http://enoughcowbell.com/2008/12/17/solving-the-mystery-of-in-rainbows-average-download-price-part-1-of-2/)\), the band still earned more money from _In Rainbows_ than their previous album, _Hail to the Thief_. But according to a new study, Radiohead could have earned even more money by adding a slight twist to their plan – telling people that half their voluntary payments would go to charity."

[Pay what you want](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want) \#article - Wikipedia. "**Pay what you want** \(or **PWYW**, also referred to as "**Value-for-Value** model"\)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want#cite_note-2) is a [pricing strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing_strategies) where buyers pay their desired amount for a given commodity, sometimes including zero. In some cases, a minimum \(floor\) price may be set, and/or a suggested price may be indicated as guidance for the buyer. The buyer can also select an amount higher than the standard price for the commodity.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want#cite_note-pay2-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want#cite_note-Smart_Pricing2-4) Many common uses of PWYW set the price prior to a purchase, but some defer price-setting until after the experience of consumption \(much like [tipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratuity)\). PWYW is a buyer-centered form of participatory pricing, also referred to as co-pricing \(as an aspect of the [co-creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-creation) of value\)."

[Performance artist gives his entire fee to the audience, asks them to give back what he's worth](https://boingboing.net/2011/03/03/performance-artist-g.html) \#article - "Performance artist Mike Daisey's show at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, "The Last Cargo Cult," started with the attendees being handed US currency \(notes ranging from $1 to $100\) as they came into the theatre. As Daisey's show drew to a close, he revealed that the money the audience had been given was the entire sum that the theatre was paying him to perform that night. He then asked the audience to give back some or all of the money based on their impression of the show -- and if they liked it enough, they were invited to give even more money back. At the end of the show, Daisey had not only made back all the money he'd given away, he'd also cleared $1,169.005 \(yes, someone gave him half a penny!\)."

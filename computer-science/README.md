[Algorithm Aversion: People Erroneously Avoid Algorithms After Seeing Them Err](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/WPAF201410-AlgorthimAversion-Dietvorst-Simmons-Massey.pdf) #paper - "Research shows that evidence-based algorithms more accurately predict the future than do human forecasters. Yet when forecasters are deciding whether to use a human forecaster or a statistical algorithm, they often choose the human forecaster. This phenomenon, which we call algorithm aversion, is costly, and it is important to understand its causes. We show that people are especially averse to algorithmic forecasters after seeing them perform, even when they see them outperform a human forecaster. This is because people more quickly lose confidence in algorithmic than human forecasters after seeing them make the same mistake. In 5 studies, participants either saw an algorithm make forecasts, a human make forecasts, both, or neither. They then decided whether to tie their incentives to the future predictions of the algorithm or the human. Participants who saw the algorithm perform were less confident in it, and less likely to choose it over an inferior human forecaster. This was true even among those who saw the algorithm outperform the human."

## Quantum Computing

[GOTO 2019 • Introduction to Quantum Computing • Jessica Pointing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1RnYo0nYGM) #video - "Certain types of problems can take billions of years to solve on our current conventional computers. Quantum computers, however, can solve these types of problems in just seconds. Because of their ‘quantum power’, quantum computers have the potential to impact many fields, such as machine learning, medicine, and energy systems."

[PHYSICISTS ARE BEWITCHED BY TWISTED GRAPHENE'S 'MAGIC ANGLE'](https://www.wired.com/story/twisted-bilayer-graphene/) #article - "Jarillo-Herrero has never been a slacker, but his activity has jumped several levels since his dramatic announcement in March 2018 that his lab at MIT had found superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene—a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon crystal dropped on another one, and then rotated to leave the two layers slightly askew."

[THE WIRED GUIDE TO QUANTUM COMPUTING](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-quantum-computing/?itm\_campaign=GuideCarveLeft\&mbid=rss-google-newsstand) #article - "BIG THINGS HAPPEN when computers get smaller. Or faster. And [quantum computing](https://www.wired.com/tag/quantum-computing/) is about chasing perhaps the biggest performance boost in the history of technology. The basic idea is to smash some barriers that limit the speed of existing computers by harnessing the counterintuitive physics of subatomic scales."

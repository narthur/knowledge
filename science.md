This discipline overlaps with [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics), [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), and [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology), for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth). Philosophy of science focuses on metaphysical, epistemic and semantic aspects of science. Ethical issues such as [bioethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics) and [scientific misconduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct) are often considered [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) or [science studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_studies) rather than philosophy of science."

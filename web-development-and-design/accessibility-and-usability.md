[Calculating Color Contrast](https://24ways.org/2010/calculating-color-contrast/) \#article - “Some websites and services allow you to customize your profile by uploading pictures, changing the background color or other aspects of the design. As a customer, this personalization turns a web app into your little nest where you store your data. As a designer, letting your customers have free rein over the layout and design is a scary prospect. So what happens to all the stock text and images that are designed to work on nice white backgrounds? Even the Mac only lets you choose between two colors for the OS, blue or graphite! Opening up the ability to customize your site’s color scheme can be a recipe for disaster unless you are flexible and understand how to find maximum color contrasts.” \#javascript \#php \#color \#accessibility

[Don't Reinvent the Wheel](https://www.colorado.edu/accessible-technology/2018/02/28/dont-reinvent-wheel) \#article - "If you’re trying to create an innovative car that will expand for extra passengers or cargo and shrink when you want to park it between a couple of enormous SUVs, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. You might decide to modify the frame or axles in some way, but it’s already generally established that a round, rubber wheel is the best way to get around on American roads. The same principle applies to designing digital content: be deliberate about when you use well-established tools and when you design in a new way."

[Intro to ARIA -- A11ycasts \#13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Qff0b-lHk) \#video - "Here on a11ycasts I always try to encourage developers to use native controls rather than roll their own mainly because you get semantics and keyboard functionality for free. But there are situations where you need to build something and there's no native analog in the platform. For these occasions when you need to go offroad and build your own control, the Web Content Accessibility Initiatives Accessible Rich Internet Applications spec \(WAI-ARIA\) can help you add in the semantics your new custom control is missing. Today on the show I'll cover what ARIA is from a high level and show off some of the features and relationships ARIA let's you take advantage of."

[Pixels vs. Ems: Users DO Change Font Size](https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773) \#article - “The question was “How many users browse the main Internet Archive site with a default font size other than the common value of 16 pixels?” By knowing this, we would determine how many users would be affected by sizing with relative units like rems/ems. Using the methodology I describe below, we found that the answer is 3.08% of our users. That’s a pretty big number, higher than most counts of the market share of browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge, or Opera Mini.”

Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably."

Android Automate

[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) - "This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user."

[Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn) - "Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online. They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf. Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server. You always know who has your data. You do."

[Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/en/) - "Integromat is the most advanced online automation platform. We've redefined work automation so everyone can get back to what matters the most."

[Android and Beeminder and Tasker](https://blog.beeminder.com/beedroid/) \#article - "Tasker is like [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) for your Android. It exposes triggers and events that you can string together kind of like a recipe. It lets you plug in Beeminder as the event portion of a recipe, and so you can do things like automatically mind your sleep based on how long your phone’s display is off at night, or start a timer every time you launch Candy Crush Saga, and stop and submit the datapoint every time you quit the app. "

[Android intents in Tasker](https://notenoughtech.com/tasker/android-intents-in-tasker/) \#article - "In my recent post about [run shell](https://notenoughtech.com/tasker/tasker-run-shell-commands/) actions in Tasker I listed over 40 different shell commands to help you toggle settings on your Android device. There is one more way of forcing specific actions, especially within different applications. Android intents in Tasker are another way to communicate with applications by passing a command, that often consist an action and parameters to complete this action."

[Beginner’s guide to Tasker, part 5: Tips & tricks](https://www.pocketables.com/2012/09/beginners-guide-to-tasker-part-5-tips-tricks.html) \#article - "[The previous four parts of this guide](https://www.pocketables.com/tag/beginners-guide-to-tasker) have been thorough, but this is Tasker – thorough only covers a small corner. Sometimes things aren’t as simple as they seem, and other times things are actually simpler than they seem. This part will be dedicated to various tips and tricks for using Tasker, things that aren’t as obvious as they perhaps should be. I’ve tried to think of as many as I can, but there might be a second tips and tricks in the future if I think of more."

AutoTools Web screens just got updated with Post-It notes – the sticky notes that are displayed as an overlay, so I thought I create a project that replicates the original purpose of the notes: leaving more or less useful messages for your friends and family."

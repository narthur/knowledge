## Autofocus

[The Autofocus Time Management System](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/) \#article \#video - "The system consists of one long list of everything that you have to do, written in a ruled notebook \(25-35 lines to a page ideal\). As you think of new items, add them to the end of the list. You work through the list one page at a time in the following manner..."

* Take a notebook and write down tasks in the order they occur to you.
  * Include the date of entry for the first item on each page to help you monitor progress.
* When completing tasks, take each page as a unit and work on it for as long as you feel like working on it.
  * First, review the entire page just to remind yourself what's on it that is yet to be completed.
  * Then, start back at the top of the page, looking at each item in turn, until you come to an item that you feel is ready to be done.
  * Commit yourself to that item by placing a dot next to it.
  * Work on the task as long as you'd like.
  * If you haven't completed the task or the task is recurring in nature, write it again at the end of your notebook.
  * Strike out the instance of the task you committed to, whether or not you completed it.
  * Review the page again, looking for another task you feel ready to complete, repeating this process until you don't feel ready to complete any tasks on this page, at which point you move to the next page.
* When you wish to move on, start working on the next page.
* When you run out of pages with tasks on them, go back to the first page.
* When you finish a page completely, put an X on the top outside corner. When there are no active pages previous to a completed page, add a circle around the X.
* If you feel a task will never be completed, you can dismiss an item by highlighting it.

## Prioritizing

[7 Ways to Identify your Most Important Task](https://medium.com/@refinedliz/7-ways-to-identify-your-most-important-task-9e165ebb3535) \#article - "It’s one of the most consistent and repeatedly given productivity advice here on Medium: start your day with your most important task \(MIT\). It’s easy to know why: If you get your MIT done first thing in the morning, you’ve already won the day, no matter what comes later. But if you start your day unfocused, you are a lot less likely to get your important task done at all."

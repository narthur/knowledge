# JavaScript

## Snippets

Referencing `this` inside a callback can be tricky, since `this` refers to the context where the function is called, not where it is defined. To explicitly bind `this` to the defining context, [use the `bind()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind):

```javascript
myFunction(callback.bind(this))
```

To find the first element of an array satisfying some criteria, [use Array.prototype.find\(\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find). If you just need the index, [use .findIndex instead](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex). \([via StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18520276/937377)\)

```javascript
var array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

var found = array1.find(function(element) {
  return element > 10;
});

console.log(found);
// expected output: 12
```

[Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) \#article - ‚ÄúWhen it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.‚Äù üëç

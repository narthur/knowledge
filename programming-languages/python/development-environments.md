[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - Part of the standard library. "The [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories."

## Pipenv

[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/#pipenv-python-dev-workflow-for-humans) #software - "**Pipenv** is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. _..._ It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your `Pipfile` as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important `Pipfile.lock`, which is used to produce deterministic builds."

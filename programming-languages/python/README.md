# Python

## Snippets

[Generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) allow you to [define lazy-loaded infinite sequences](https://medium.com/@dawranliou/lazy-codes-infinite-sequences-in-python-and-clojure-80bba720b3a3):

```python
def number_generator():
    i = 0
    while True:
        yield i
        i += 1
numbers = number_generator()
next(numbers)  # 0
next(numbers)  # 1
next(numbers)  # 2
next(numbers)  # 3
#...
```

[Find first item in iterable that satisfies a criterion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9868665/937377):

```python
first = next(obj for obj in objs if obj.val==5)
```

Convert between time formats ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9637838/convert-string-date-to-timestamp-in-python/9637908#9637908), [source](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/timestamp-datetime)):

```python
import datetime
import time

# timestamp to datetime
timestamp = 1545730073
dt_object = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)

# datetime to timestamp
now = datetime.datetime.now()
timestamp = datetime.datetime.timestamp(now)

# date string to timestamp
s = "01/12/2011"
timestamp = time.mktime(datetime.datetime.strptime(s, "%d/%m/%Y").timetuple())
```

Get list of dictionary keys sorted by their values ([source](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-sort-python-dictionaries-by-key-or-value/)):

```python
numbers = {'first': 1, 'second': 2, 'third': 3, 'Fourth': 4}
# Use the __getitem__ method as the key function
sorted(numbers, key=numbers.__getitem__)
# In order of sorted values: [1, 2, 3, 4]
['first', 'second', 'third', 'Fourth']
```

Check of datetime object is localized ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27596917/937377)):

```python
d.tzinfo is not None and d.tzinfo.utcoffset(d) is not None
```

[Python's `strftime` directives](http://strftime.org) - "I need to use Python’s `strftime` rarely enough that I can’t remember it off the top of my head and never bookmark it but often enough to be annoyed with having to Google “python strftime” and then find the table above in the Python documentation.

It was originally inspired by [RunSnakeRun](http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun/). SnakeViz works on Python 2.7 and Python 3. SnakeViz itself is still likely to work on Python 2.6, but official support has been dropped now that [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org) no longer supports Python 2.6."

Until the release of Python 3.3, there was no comprehensive explanation of the expected import semantics, and even following the release of 3.3, the details of how `sys.path` is initialised are still somewhat challenging to figure out."

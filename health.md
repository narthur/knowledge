[Chef Ani](https://chefani.com/) \#blog \#channel - "I am a graduate of the Natural Gourmet Institute of New York City. I love to cook and have been in the kitchen as far back as I can remember. A life-long vegetarian and now a plant-based chef, I enjoy junk food as much as the next guy, but realize that though it tastes good, it is not good for me. Have you ever heard the saying: “You are what you eat”? Well, science is telling us that this is absolutely true. The food choices we make today are super important to how we feel and operate tomorrow. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could come up with recipes that do both, taste delicious and make us feel wonderful? That is my quest."

\_\_[_Deep Medicine_](https://drerictopol.com/book/deep-medicine/) \#book - "Medicine has become inhuman, to disastrous effect. The doctor-patient relationship–the heart of medicine–is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In Deep Medicine, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard."

[Spoon theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) \#article - Wikipedia. "**Spoon theory**[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory#cite_note-1) is a metaphor that is used to describe the amount of mental or physical energy a person has available for daily activities and tasks. The theory was developed by Christine Miserandino as a way to express how it felt to have [lupus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus). She used [spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon) to provide a visual representation of units of energy that a person might have and how [chronic illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_illness) forces her to plan out her days and actions in advance, so as not to run out of energy, or spoons, before the end of the day.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory#cite_note-Miserandino-2)"

## Sleep

## Weight Control

[Effects of Bite Count Feedback from a Wearable Device and Goal Setting on Consumption in Young Adults](https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672%2816%2930222-2/abstract) \#paper - "Providing feedback on the number of bites taken from a wearable intake monitor can reduce overall intake during a single meal. Regarding the first research question, providing feedback significantly reduced intake in both plate size groups and reduced the overall number of bites taken. Regarding the second research question, participants were successful in eating to their goals. However, individuals in the low goal condition appeared to compensate for the restricted goal by taking larger bites, leading to comparable levels of consumption between the low and high goal groups. Hence, the interaction of technology with goals should be considered when introducing a health intervention."

[The Hacker's Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker%27s_Diet) \#article - Wikipedia. "**The Hacker's Diet** \(humorously subtitled "How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition"\) is a [diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting) plan created by the founder of [Autodesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk), [John Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker_%28programmer%29), outlined in an [electronic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book) of the same name, that attempts to aid the process of [weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss) by more accurately modeling how [calories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie) consumed and calories expended actually impact weight. Walker notes that much of our [fat free mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition) introduces [signal noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_noise) when trying to determine how much weight we're actually losing or gaining. With the help of a graphing tool \([Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel) is used in the book\), he addresses these problems.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker%27s_Diet#cite_note-1) Factoring in [exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise), and through counting calories, one can calculate one's own total energy expenditure \([basal metabolic rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate), [thermic effect of food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermic_effect_of_food), and day-to-day exercise\) and cut back calorie intake or increase exercise to lose weight."

First, “The Need to Know” covers this week’s main story—one story, several paragraphs, and opinions separated at the end. The second section, “The Ought to Know,” covers other stories—each paragraph is a separate story entirely. Lastly, while our content is serious, our headings are not. We like to spice up our headings with a little personality. :\)"

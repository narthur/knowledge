[Read by Refactoring](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/read-by-refactoring/) \#article - "Read by Refactoring is a technique discussed and taught by Arlo Belshee [\(@arlobelshee](https://twitter.com/arlobelshee)\) at [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com/). Using this technique, reading code – to figure out what it does, to estimate the effort to modify it, etc. – turns into active refactoring of the code. You read the code by modifying it, nudging it into a clearer, more readable state. The key is you are leveraging your IDE’s built in refactoring functions and mastering the keyboard shortcuts in such a way that your insights of how the code can be improved translate immediately into modification of the code. I’m typing this sentence with no conscious decision of what key to hit or even any thought to commanding my fingers where to go on the keyboard, but the words I think nevertheless appear on the screen. You want to get your mastery of your refactoring tools to the same unconscious, effortless state."

[Testing Legacy Code Elliotte by Rusty Harold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxXv0eifhY) \#video - "You've been bitten by the testing bug, are thoroughly test infected. Excellent! You're undoubtedly producing more robust, less buggy software faster and at lower cost. Sadly, it wasn't always this way. You're saddled with a large legacy of untested code. Test first development is not an option. Nonetheless unit testing, JUnit, and test driven development can still dramatically improve your maintenance tasks. Learn strategies for retrofitting test frameworks onto existing code, and developing a test suite for code that never had one before."

[Biggest Challenge You'll Face Learning to Code \(Plus How to Overcome It!\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-sh_ncnDUE) \#video - "Learning any new skill is challenging and I've definitely noticed a recurring theme that most everybody faces: how to stay motivated when progress seems to be non-existent \(also know as the intermediate plateau\). There's is no easy answer or magic pill but I definitely laid out a few pieces of advice of how to overcome it."

[CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) - "Continuous Integration \(CI\) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.

I happen to practice a degree of ascetical programming practices, and I believe that they help me to more deeply internalize and understand problems, ultimately delivering higher quality solutions. One of the ways that I do this is the use of paper programming."

## Deep Work

Build in public

[CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) - "Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise \(perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long\). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways. Some are open ended, and involve thinking about the issues behind programming. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer. I add a new kata every week or so. Invest some time in your craft and try them."

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) - "Improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges"

[Threat model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) \#article - Wikipedia. "**Threat modeling** is a process by which potential threats, such as [structural vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_vulnerability_%28computing%29) or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”."

[StateCharts](https://statecharts.github.io/) - "Put simply, a statechart is a beefed up [state machine](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html). The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially [state explosion](https://statecharts.github.io/state-machine-state-explosion.html) that happens as state machines grow. One of the goals of this site is to help explain what statecharts are and how they are useful."

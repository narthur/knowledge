This enables you to rapidly and reliably deliver features and updates. You can easily integrate AWS CodePipeline with third-party services such as GitHub or with your own custom plugin. With AWS CodePipeline, you only pay for what you use. There are no upfront fees or long-term commitments."

[CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) - "Continuous Integration \(CI\) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. ❡ By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily."

[Continuous Integration - What's the point? - Continuous Integration P1 - Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymPOI4gWQFY) \#video - "Continuous Integration is when a software development team has a habit of doing _multiple merges per day_ and have an _automated verification system_ that checks those merges for problems. Our team does this in order to waste less time hunting down problems in _monster merges_."

## Deep Work

Build in public

[CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) - "Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise \(perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long\). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways. Some are open ended, and involve thinking about the issues behind programming. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer. I add a new kata every week or so. Invest some time in your craft and try them."

[GOTO 2018 • The Do's and Don'ts of Error Handling • Joe Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTM_b7EJg5E) \#video - "Handling errors in programs is tricky. We want to write systems that work reasonable well even if there are errors in the code. This is possible, and the results have been used in production systems for many years. This talk outlines the do's and don'ts of error handling. Things you should do if you want to write fault tolerant code, and things you should not do."

[Threat model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) \#article - Wikipedia. "**Threat modeling** is a process by which potential threats, such as [structural vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_vulnerability_%28computing%29) or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”."

The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially [state explosion](https://statecharts.github.io/state-machine-state-explosion.html) that happens as state machines grow. One of the goals of this site is to help explain what statecharts are and how they are useful."

If the class does not receive any communication for 5 seconds, the property reverts to a default value. ‚Ä¶ How would you test to be sure that this property has the proper value when simulating various communication conditions?‚Äù #q\&a

## **Approval Tests**

[Approval Testing: Agile Testing that Scales](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/approvaltest.php) **** #article - "Tests are a form of the [specification of the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification\_by\_example). That is why, in an agile world where software never "stabilizes", tests can quickly move from being a pillar of quality to a burden and hindrance to change. Approval Testing mitigates this risk by removing the need for explicit assertions and instead managing changes to the system behaviour. Read this article to find out how it can help you 1) create automated tests more quickly ;2) have them test more thoroughly and 3) have them adapt much more easily than you ever thought was possible, also when a large amount of functionality is under test."

[Approval Tests](https://approvaltests.com/) - "Unit testing asserts can be difficult to use. Approval tests simplify this by taking a snapshot of the results, and confirming that they have not changed." [GitHub](https://github.com/approvals)

## **Mutation Testing**

[Infection](https://infection.github.io/) - #php

[Mutation Testing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20905/mutation-testing) #article - ‚ÄúMutation testing is a method of software testing in which program or source code is deliberately manipulated, followed by suite of testing against the mutated code. The mutations introduced to source code are designed to imitate common programming errors. A good unit test suite typically detects the program mutations and fails automatically.‚Äù

## Testable Architecture

[Auto-mocking Container by Mark Seemann](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/03/11/auto-mocking-container/) #article - "A major problem with unit tests is to make sure that they are robust in the face of a changing system. One of the most common problems programmers have with unit tests is the so-called [Fragile Test](http://xunitpatterns.com/Fragile%20Test.html) smell. Every time you attempt to refactor your code, tests break."

## Test-Driven Development

[Effective Unit Testing by Eliotte Rusty Harold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr1E9aVnBxw) #video - "You've been bitten by the testing bug, are thoroughly test infected. Excellent! You're undoubtedly producing more robust, less buggy software faster and at lower cost. Now it‚Äôs time to think about what makes unit tests even better. We‚Äôll discuss flakiness, debuggability, reproducibility, speed, specificity, independence, timing, and other characteristics of effective unit tests. Examples will be in Java and JUnit, but the principles apply generally to all languages and test frameworks."

[gregmalcolm/python\_koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python\_koans) - "As well as being a great way to learn some Python, it is also a good way to get a taste of Test Driven Development (TDD)."

[Test-driven development with Haskell](https://github.com/erohkohl/haskell-tdd) - "This project contains my custom workflow for test-driven development in Haskell and serves as documentation for me."

[Understanding TDD with Modern JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneGCBiPK\_Q) #video - "Javascript has evolved into an ecosystem with many choices and multiple paradigms of programming. In this session Roy will show how test driven development can still work and be applied to backend and frontend situations using ES2015 as well as the core concepts of TDD and why it can be helpful in your day to day job."

## Testing Legacy Code

[Testing Legacy Code Elliotte by Rusty Harold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxXv0eifhY\&t=1680s) #video - "You've been bitten by the testing bug, are thoroughly test infected. Excellent! You're undoubtedly producing more robust, less buggy software faster and at lower cost. Sadly, it wasn't always this way. You're saddled with a large legacy of untested code. Test first development is not an option. Nonetheless unit testing, JUnit, and test driven development can still dramatically improve your maintenance tasks. Learn strategies for retrofitting test frameworks onto existing code, and developing a test suite for code that never had one before."

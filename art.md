[The Beautifully Strange World of Outsider Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVks07UgVQQ) #video - "Whether we're talking about The Shaggs, Wesley Willis, B.J. Snowden, Eilert Pilarm, Shooby Taylor, Gary Wilson, R. Stevie Moore, Tiny Tim, Luie Luie, Daniel Johnston, or whoever else -- this category of music is all about originality/authenticity. These musicians and artists aren't the most polished in the world, but they make up for it with passion and creativity. Open your mind up, go down the rabbit hole of outsider music, and have a good time!"

By adjusting the angles of folds and the depth of layers, Reinhart animates his subjects to tell dramatic stories that literally pop off the page"

[Norman Rockwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman\_Rockwell) #article - Wikipedia. "**Norman Percevel Rockwell** (February 3, 1894 â€“ November 8, 1978) was an American painter and illustrator. His works have a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of [American culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture\_of\_the\_United\_States). Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for [The Saturday Evening Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Saturday\_Evening\_Post) magazine over nearly five decades.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman\_Rockwell#cite\_note-1) Among the best-known of Rockwell's works are the [Willie Gillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie\_Gillis) series, [Rosie the Riveter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie\_the\_Riveter), [The Problem We All Live With](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Problem\_We\_All\_Live\_With), [Saying Grace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saying\_Grace\_\(Rockwell\)), and the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four\_Freedoms\_\(Norman\_Rockwell\)) series. He is also noted for his 64-year relationship with the [Boy Scouts of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy\_Scouts\_of\_America) (BSA), during which he produced covers for their publication [Boys' Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys'\_Life), calendars, and other illustrations. These works include popular images that reflect the [Scout Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout\_Promise) and [Scout Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout\_Law) such as [The Scoutmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Scoutmaster), A Scout is Reverent[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman\_Rockwell#cite\_note-2) and A Guiding Hand,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman\_Rockwell#cite\_note-3) among many others."

[The Son of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Son\_of\_Man) #article - Wikipedia. "Magritte painted it as a [self-portrait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-portrait).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Son\_of\_Man#cite\_note-2) The painting consists of a man in an [overcoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overcoat) and a [bowler hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler\_hat) standing in front of a low wall, beyond which are the [sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea) and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a [hovering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitation) green [apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple). However, the man's eyes can be seen peeking over the edge of the apple. Another subtle feature is that the man's left arm appears to bend backwards at the elbow."

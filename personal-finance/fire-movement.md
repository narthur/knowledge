[r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) - "This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent \(FI\), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early \(RE\) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate \(through less spending and/or higher income\) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible."

In this talk, Lacey shares how combining financial independence and mini-retirements is one way to bring that time rich feeling into our youth.  Lacey Filipich started her entrepreneurial journey with a hair wrap stall at 10 years old. Today, she is the co-founder and director of two successful businesses; Money School and Maker Kids Club."

[You want to know our savings rate? Which one?](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/04/05/savings-rate/) \#article - "Last week, I read a [nice post on Chief Mom Officer](https://chiefmomofficer.org/2017/03/27/why-your-savings-rate-is-meaningless/) on the challenges of calculating savings rates. Right around that time I was also revisiting our 2017 budget and the projections of how much we are going to save this year. This is the last full calendar year before our planned retirement in early 2018 and it’s imperative that we stay on track and keep a high savings rate on the home stretch. But how high is our savings rate? Is there even a generally accepted way of calculating a savings rate? What are some of the pitfalls? We were surprised about how easy it is to mess up a calculation as seemingly trivial as the savings rate."

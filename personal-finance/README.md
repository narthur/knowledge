## Emergency Fund

[MMM vs. The Emergency Fund - MMM Show Episode 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFpJrqp0l_4) \#video - "How much cash should I keep around in my checking account ready for emergencies? And how much cash buffer should I maintain during retirement when living off of investments? 3 months, 6 months, or a year? In this episode of the MMM Show we answer these questions."

[Our emergency fund is exactly $0.00](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/05/05/emergency-fund/) \#article - "In our financial plan, you will never find the one staple item that every financial planner calls the cornerstone of a responsible financial plan: the **emergency fund**. We have none. Zilch. Nada."

Lots of visitor traffic came from both [Physician of FIRE](http://www.physicianonfire.com/sunday-best-5152016/) and [Rockstar Finance](http://rockstarfinance.com/) \(thanks for featuring us!!!\) and most comments were very supportive. Good to know that others follow a similar approach. To make the case more complete we should also look at some of the standard arguments people normally use _in favor_ of keeping a large stash of cash for emergencies."

## Frugality

[Living well on the trailing edge of Luxury](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/29/living-well-on-the-trailing-edge-of-luxury/) \#article - Mr. Money Mustache. "Because of this exponential change, our world is awash in almost-new consumer products. The hottest ones are in the stores, and the hottest ones from just a few months ago are abandoned in people’s drawers and garages. You almost NEVER need to buy anything new, because you can have an almost-new item for 25-50% of the cost out of one of these drawers. People are so accustomed to buying new things, that they are willing to almost give away their used things even when they are barely used."

[The MMM Show - Episode 5 - Why Gas Is Really $42 Per Gallon!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6t1Xk-yJIc) \#video - "Should you move closer to work even if it means higher rent \(or house prices?\)"

And the other person said, “Bah! Recipe for bankruptcy! You need full insurance!”. Which person was right?"

[Lemonade](https://www.lemonade.com) - "Home and Renters Insurance for Urban Dwellers. Lemonade's amazing coverage protects the stuff you own at home and everywhere else."

[Root](https://www.joinroot.com/) - "Save up to 52% on your car insurance. Get a rate based primarily on how you drive. Fair insurance. No gimmicks."

[Cait Flanders](https://caitflanders.com/) \#blog - "Hi friend! My name is Cait. I’m an author, podcaster, and traveller from a beautiful island in British Columbia, Canada. For the past nine years, you could say I’ve been on a journey of less. Less debt. Less clutter. Less consumerism. Less alcohol \(ok, _no_ alcohol\). Less time online/on my phone. Less consumption overall. I wrote a self-help memoir that documents some of what I have experienced and discovered. [_The Year of Less_](https://caitflanders.com/the-year-of-less/) __came out in January 2018 and became a Wall Street Journal bestseller."

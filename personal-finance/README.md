[For Love and/or Money: Financial Autonomy in Marriage](http://messymatters.com/autonomy/) #article - "We realize how crazy this all sounds! Nonetheless, we’re perfectly serious, and do actually pay each other to put our kids to bed and whatnot. We think we have quite clever mechanisms for deciding who does what and keeping things exquisitely fair, efficient, and resentment-free. And separate finances — i.e., financial autonomy — is a prerequisite."

## Emergency Fund

[MMM vs. The Emergency Fund - MMM Show Episode 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFpJrqp0l\_4) #video - "How much cash should I keep around in my checking account ready for emergencies? And how much cash buffer should I maintain during retirement when living off of investments? 3 months, 6 months, or a year? In this episode of the MMM Show we answer these questions."

[Our emergency fund is exactly $0.00](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/05/05/emergency-fund/) #article - "In our financial plan, you will never find the one staple item that every financial planner calls the cornerstone of a responsible financial plan: the **emergency fund**. We have none. Zilch. Nada."

[Top 10 reasons for having an emergency fund – debunked (Part 1)](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/07/debunking-emergency-funds-part1/) #article - "In a past blog post, we pointed out that a [$0.00 emergency fund is most useful for us](http://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/05/05/emergency-fund/). Lots of visitor traffic came from both [Physician of FIRE](http://www.physicianonfire.com/sunday-best-5152016/) and [Rockstar Finance](http://rockstarfinance.com) (thanks for featuring us!!!) and most comments were very supportive. Good to know that others follow a similar approach. To make the case more complete we should also look at some of the standard arguments people normally use_ in favor_ of keeping a large stash of cash for emergencies."

## Frugality

[Buying Foods Based on Cost Per Calorie | The Simple Dollar](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/save-money/buying-foods-based-on-cost-per-calorie/#:\~:text=You%20might%20also%20notice%20that%20eggs%20are%20cheap%2C,makes%20for%20a%20reasonable%20occasional%20breakfast%20food%2C%20too.) #article - "Recently, I came across [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/wV3DiTX.png) that listed a bunch of different foods, separated by category (fruit; vegetables; fats, nuts, and seeds; fish, poultry, and eggs; whole grains; beans and tofu; red meat; and dairy) and sorted within those categories by the cost per cup or cost per 100 calories, depending on the item. (The truly low-calorie items, which were the vegetables and fruits, were listed by cost per cup, while the other more calorie-dense items were listed by cost per calorie.)"

[Insulation: first the body, then the home](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/02/body-insulation-thermal-underwear.html) #article - "You could fill a library with reports and books describing the importance of energy-efficient heating systems and home insulation. However, not a word has been said or written about the energy savings potential of clothing, even though there has been a lot of progress in this area too. Modern thermal underclothing offers the possibility to turn the thermostat much lower without sacrificing comfort or sex appeal. The potential energy savings are huge; the costs are almost nil."

[Living well on the trailing edge of Luxury](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/29/living-well-on-the-trailing-edge-of-luxury/) #article - Mr. Money Mustache. "Because of this exponential change, our world is awash in almost-new consumer products. The hottest ones are in the stores, and the hottest ones from just a few months ago are abandoned in people’s drawers and garages. You almost NEVER need to buy anything new, because you can have an almost-new item for 25-50% of the cost out of one of these drawers. People are so accustomed to buying new things, that they are willing to almost give away their used things even when they are barely used."

[The MMM Show - Episode 5 - Why Gas Is Really $42 Per Gallon!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6t1Xk-yJIc) #video - "Should you move closer to work even if it means higher rent (or house prices?)"

And the other person said, “Bah! Recipe for bankruptcy! You need full insurance!”. Which person was right?"

[Cait Flanders](https://caitflanders.com) #blog - "Hi friend! My name is Cait. I’m an author, podcaster, and traveller from a beautiful island in British Columbia, Canada. For the past nine years, you could say I’ve been on a journey of less. Less debt. Less clutter. Less consumerism. Less alcohol (ok, _no_ alcohol). Less time online/on my phone. Less consumption overall. I wrote a self-help memoir that documents some of what I have experienced and discovered. [_The Year of Less_](https://caitflanders.com/the-year-of-less/)_ _came out in January 2018 and became a Wall Street Journal bestseller."
